        <h2>What is Korean Px?</h2>
        <h3>The Px is essentially a duty-free supermarket located within army bases. It offers a range of exclusive products that
        are not available elsewhere. Due to the popularity of Px food items, some regular supermarkets have begun stocking them.
        We're here to provide you with a chance to experience some of the finest Px food available in the Korean army.
